# Voronoi_Treemap

### Introduction
Implementation of Voronoi Treemaps

### Instruction
- The generated result can refer to latest\_examples.
- Folder data_gdp is GDP data for various countries.
- Folder data_pop is populations data for countries.

You can use your own data to generate voronoi treemaps instead of using data_gdp or data_pop. Pay attention to naming data files properly.

Remember to change the data path or font path in voronoi_treemap_generator.py if need.
